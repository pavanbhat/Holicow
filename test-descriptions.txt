Test Case 1: 

Chose the same case as given in the problem statement of Lab 9.


Test Case 2:

Here there are more number of cows and paint balls as the first test case but the paint balls are not triggered
through the new ones that have been added in the field which causes the test case to be disjoint.

Test Case 3:

None of the paint balls trigger each other which might result in formation of any kind of loop. With most of the
inputs being cows in the file.
